Emergency Work Eligibility Considerations

Overview:
This document provides detailed eligibility criteria for Categories A & B emergency work. For foundational eligibility requirements (applicant, facility, basic work criteria, and cost standards), see General Eligibility Considerations.
Some details (e.g. Disposal and Reduction Methods, Structural Protection) are included for context and for use in the demo to add depth based on the userâ€™s responses. However, these considerations need not be incorporated into every demo.
