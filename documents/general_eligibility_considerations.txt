General Eligibility Considerations

Overview:
This document focuses primarily on the eligibility pyramid, the four basic building blocks that FEMA uses to determine eligibility. Additional category-specific eligibility considerations are covered separately in the Emergency Work Eligibility Considerations document. 
The four components of the eligibility pyramid are: Applicant, Facility, Work, and Cost. Below is additional information on each. 
Some details (e.g. appeals, noncompetitive procurement) are included for context and for use in the demo to add depth based on the user’s responses. However, these considerations need not be incorporated into every demo. 

Applicant
Is the Applicant an eligibility entity?
Eligible Local Governments include but are not limited to:
Counties and parishes
Municipalities, cities, towns, boroughs, townships
Local public authorities
School districts
Intrastate districts
Councils of governments
Regional and interstate government entities
Agencies or instrumentalities of local governments
State recognized Tribal Nations
Special districts established under state law

Facility
Primary questions: Are the facilities where work was performed eligible?
An eligible public facility is one that a state, local, Tribal Nation, or territorial (SLTT) government owns or has legal responsibility for maintaining.
Eligible Facilities include but are not limited to:
Systems (flood control, navigation, irrigation, reclamation, public power, sewage treatment/collection, water supply/distribution, watershed development)
Buildings (maintenance/storage sheds, restroom facilities, bath houses, outbuildings including ancillary facilities)
Non-federal-aid streets, roads, highways, ramps, access roads
Public buildings/structures/systems (educational, recreational, cultural purposes)
Airport facilities including runways
Parks (piers, docks, trails, benches, picnic tables, swimming pools, golf courses, ball fields)
Other public facilities (pumping stations, communication towers/antennas, contents, supplies, equipment, vehicles, fences, parking lots, stairs, signage, lighting, sidewalks, gutters, ditches, guard rails, integral ground, catch basins, outfall structures)
Active Use Requirement:
Facility must have been in active use at start of incident period
Inactive or partially inactive facilities are ineligible unless:
Only temporarily inactive for repairs/remodeling (contractor not responsible for disaster damage)
Applicant established future active use in approved budget/plans
Applicant can demonstrate intent to begin use within reasonable time
For partially occupied facilities, assistance prorated to percentage in active use

Work
Primary questions: Is the work performed, or planning to be performed, eligible?
Work must meet ALL three criteria:
Required as result of declared incident
Impacts/damage occurred during declared incident period
Damage caused directly by declared incident
Work claimed is required to address incident-related impacts/damage
INELIGIBLE examples:
Previously existing damage or debris
Impacts from different incident (even during same period)
Damage occurring after incident period but before repairs
Deterioration (wear and tear)
Deferred maintenance
Damage due to failure to protect facility timely
Damage due to negligence
Located within declared area (except sheltering, evacuation, EOC activities)
Legal responsibility of eligible applicant
Applicant had jurisdiction over area or legal authority to conduct work at time of incident.
Documentation Requirements: Deed, title, lease agreement, bill of sale, land contract, mortgage documentation, property tax receipt, insurance policy, or contract

Cost
Primary questions: Are costs directly tied to the damages? Are the costs necessary and reasonable?
All costs must be:
Directly tied to performance of eligible work
Adequately documented, substantiated, or certified
Reduced by applicable credits (insurance proceeds, salvage values)
FEMA must reduce eligible costs by actual or anticipated insurance proceeds and other financial assistance for same work
Authorized and not prohibited under federal/state/local laws
Consistent with applicant's internal policies applied uniformly
Necessary and reasonable to accomplish work properly and efficiently 
A cost is reasonable if it does not exceed what a prudent person would incur under prevailing circumstances. FEMA evaluates reasonableness by considering factors including but not limited to:
Type generally recognized as ordinary and necessary for facility/work type
Appropriate skill level and level of effort for required activity
Sound business practices and arm's length bargaining
Prudent action under circumstances
Consistency with applicant's established practices/policies
Compliance with procurement requirements
Comparability to current market price in geographical area
FEMA uses cost comparison methods including but not limited to:
Historical documentation (previous contracts, invoices)
Average costs in area (weighted average unit pricing)
Published unit costs from national databases (RS Means, BNi Costbooks, etc.)
Federal, state, territorial unit costs
FEMA cost codes
For contract work, noncompetitive procurement is only allowed when circumstances include but are not limited to:
Item available from one source only
Public exigency/emergency won't permit competitive delay
FEMA/recipient expressly authorizes
Competition determined inadequate after soliciting several sources
Force Account (Applicant Personnel) Labor:
Reimbursement Basis: Actual hourly rates plus actual fringe benefits percentage
Eligible Fringe Benefits include but are not limited to: Holiday leave, accrued sick/vacation leave, social security/Medicare matching, unemployment insurance, workers' compensation, retirement, health/life/disability insurance, administrative leave
Ineligible Labor Costs: Employees on leave (regardless of leave type availability), administrative leave for employees sent home due to emergency conditions
Equipment Costs:
Applicant-Owned Equipment: FEMA published equipment rates (includes depreciation, overhead, overhaul, maintenance, lubrication, tires, ground engaging components, fuel)
Rented/Leased Equipment: Based on rental agreement terms if applicant analyzed rental vs. purchase costs and total rental costs don't exceed purchase/maintenance costs over project life
Materials and Supplies:
Eligible: Purchased and justifiably needed for incident response/recovery OR taken from applicant stock and used for incident (with proper inventory tracking)
Contract Costs:
Basic Requirements: Must comply with federal procurement requirements, full and open competition (with limited exceptions), cost or price analysis for procurements above simplified acquisition threshold, contractor integrity evaluation, suspension/debarment verification
Prohibited Contract Types: Cost-plus-percentage-of-cost contracts, percentage-of-construction contracts, time-and-materials (limited exceptions with ceiling price and high oversight)

Appeals Process
If the Applicant disagrees with FEMA’s eligibility determinations, it can pursue the appeals process.

Second Appeal: To Assistant Administrator within 60 days of first appeal decision
Requirements: Written justification, specific funding amounts in dispute, legal/regulatory basis for disagreement
